# Unsupervised Learning Project

## Overview

In the following lessons, you have learned what Unsupervised Machine Learning is, what problems are suitable for a solution based on Unsupervised Machine Learning, how to apply Unsupervised Machine Learning, and you have practiced implementing the basic phases of a solution using Scikit-learn. Now is time to put all that conceptual and procedural knowledge to work by doing a larger project. Choose a problem domain that motivates you, and build a complete solution implementing all the phases you learned about in previous chapters. We provide some ideas of interesting problem domains in a dedicated section in this lesson, but we want you to be creative and adventurous, and explore other options as well.

## External Interface Requirements

1. Input requirement: capacity to read a dataset stored on disk.
2. Output requirement: report on the model and quality metric.
3. Output requirement: identifiers of classes corresponding to new instances classified by the model.

## Functional Requirements

1. The software must be able to learn a model from a unsupervised dataset.
2. The software must use the learned clusterization to classify new problem instances.
3. The software must evaluate the quality of the model.

## Technical Requirements

1. Use Python as programming language.
2. Use Pandas for reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
3. Use Scikit-learn for training and testing the Machine Learning model.

## Necessary Deliverables

1. Github repo: it's gonna contain your presentation, README (including a link to your Trello board), and your Jupyter notebooks.
2. Report containing quality metrics, and explanation of the dataset, and the experimental procedure (whether a single split was performed, or cross-validation, etc.).

## Suggestions to Get Started
1. Find an interesting dataset! Look in the Useful Resources section for sources of ideas.
2. Break down the project into smaller tasks, for instance: importing the dataset, training, etc.
3. Decide whether you will create a single Python application or several Python applications.

## What to Do When Feeling Stuck
If you get stuck at some stage of the project, and you cannot find a way out, you can try this:
1. Nothing you are asked to do in this project is new, you have examples of all the ingredients you need in the previous lessons. Go back to the previous lessons and review the procedure used there to move on.
2. Think at a level higher than the details of the problem, at the methodology level, and identify on what stage of the methodology you are stuck, and rephrase for yourself the reason why you are stuck, and why the solutions presented in the examples of the previous lessons are not helping you to find a solution.
3. Check with your peers whether they got stuck at the same point, and what they did to move on.
4. Consult with your instructor.

## Presentation  
Presentations for this project will be in the classroom! Presentations will be **EXACTLY** 5 minutes long, with 2 additional minutes for questions. We will stop you!  
After the presentations, the audience will evaluate you by indicating how well they understood what you were trying to present and how you presented it. This information will help you in further presentations!

## Potential Project Ideas

1. Segment smartphone users according to phone usage and apps installed.
2. Segment healthy person under 50 years of age according to their risk or propensity of suffering from Alzheimer's disease after 70 years of age.
3. Classify computer network traffic as a means to detect patterns of anomalous flows.
